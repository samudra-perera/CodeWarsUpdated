/* The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

Input
Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

Output
Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

Example
input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]

Story
Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

Task

Task
Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

/* Dot Calculator
You have to write a calculator that receives strings for input. The dots will represent the number in the equation. There will be dots on one side, an operator, and dots again after the operator. The dots and the operator will be separated by one space.

- Subtraction
* Multiplication

Your Work (Task)
You'll have to return a string that contains dots, as many the equation returns. If the result is 0, return the empty string. When it comes to subtraction, the first number will always be greater than or equal to the second number.

/* The drawing below gives an idea of how to cut a given "true" rectangle into squares ("true" rectangle meaning that the two dimensions are different).

alternative text

Can you translate this drawing into an algorithm?

You will be given two dimensions

a positive integer length
a positive integer width
You will return a collection or a string (depending on the language; Shell bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran return a string) with the size of each of the squares.

Examples in general form:
(depending on the language)

  sqInRect(5, 3) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
  sqInRect(3, 5) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
  
  You can see examples for your language in **"SAMPLE TESTS".**
Notes:
lng == wdth as a starting case would be an entirely different problem and the drawing is planned to be interpreted with lng != wdth. (See kata, Square into Squares. Protect trees! http://www.codewars.com/kata/54eb33e5bc1a25440d000891 for this problem).

When the initial parameters are so that lng == wdth, the solution [lng] would be the most obvious but not in the spirit of this kata so, in that case, return None/nil/null/Nothing or return {} with C++, Array() with Scala, [] with Perl, Raku.

In that case the returned structure of C will have its sz component equal to 0.

Return the string "nil" with Bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran. */

You are provided with a list (or array) of integer pairs. Elements of each pair represent number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.

Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D

Take a look on the test cases.

Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the return integer can't be negative.

The second value in the first integer array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.

A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true

/* Sort an array by value and index
Your task is to sort an array of integer numbers by the product of the value and the index of the positions.

For sorting the index starts at 1, NOT at 0!
The sorting has to be ascending.
The array will never be null and will always contain numbers.

Example:

Input: 23, 2, 3, 4, 5
Product of value and index:
23 => 23 * 1 = 23  -> Output-Pos 4
 2 =>  2 * 2 = 4   -> Output-Pos 1
 3 =>  3 * 3 = 9   -> Output-Pos 2
 4 =>  4 * 4 = 16  -> Output-Pos 3
 5 =>  5 * 5 = 25  -> Output-Pos 5

Array/list's numbers Will be only Positives

Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur.

Input >> Output Examples
productArray ({12,20}) ==>  return {20,12}
Explanation:
The first element in prod [] array 12 is the product of all array's elements except the first element

The second element 20 is the product of all array's elements except the second element .

productArray ({1,5,2}) ==> return {10,2,5}
Explanation:
The first element 10 is the product of all array's elements except the first element 1

The second element 2 is the product of all array's elements except the second element 5

The Third element 5 is the product of all array's elements except the Third element 2.

productArray ({10,3,5,6,2}) return ==> {180,600,360,300,900}
Explanation:
The first element 180 is the product of all array's elements except the first element 10

The second element 600 is the product of all array's elements except the second element 3

The Third element 360 is the product of all array's elements except the third element 5

The Fourth element 300 is the product of all array's elements except the fourth element 6

Finally ,The Fifth element 900 is the product of all array's elements except the fifth element 2
